\begin{abstract}
In this experiment, a variable capacitor was built by using aluminum foil, A4 paper, and a PVC pipe. The capacitor was used to implement a high and low pass filter, through which AC signals were passed at varying frequencies and the output was measured using an oscilloscope, thus allowing for the calculation of the capacitance. The high pass filter led to a maximum capacitance of 0.88 nF, while the low pass filter led to a maximum capacitance of 0.76 nF, compared to the measured max. capacitance of 0.82 nF. Further, low pass filter led to a minimum capacitance of 0.46 nF, compared to a calculated capacitance of 0.33 nF.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}\lowercase{he} goal of this lab was to build an inductor and connect it to a simple inductor-capacitor (LC) circuit. In doing so, the aim was to determine the resonance frequency ($F_{r}$) of the circuit and thus determine the inductance of the built inductor.

\noindnet Inductors may be described as a two-terminal coil of conducing wire, which produces a magnetic field as current is passed through it. While an inductor acts as a short-circuit to direct current (DC), the main quality of an inductor is that it opposes the changing of current direction through it. 



\noindent Capacitors are essentially two metallic plates, often with a dielectric material in between, which serves the purpose of reducing the electric field strength and thus increasing capacitance. Reducing the electric field strength has the effect of reducing the voltage; storing charge at a lower voltage increases the capacitance of the capacitor (see Equation \ref{eq:cap}).

\begin{equation}
C \propto \frac{1}{E}
\label{eq:cap}
\end{equation}

\section{Building the Capacitor}

\noindent A capacitor is simply two metal plates with an insulating material (dielectric) in between; it can be made variable by varying the effective area of the plates or distance between plates. Thus, this lab used two pieces aluminum foil with a piece of paper in between. It was designed so that the the top piece of aluminum was capable of sliding up or down the bottom piece to increase or decrease the area and thus the capacitance. \\

\noindent A piece of aluminum foil, slightly smaller than the size of an A4 paper, was taped to an A4 paper. One end of a multi-core wire was stripped and spread out across the aluminium piece to increase surface area, completing the first component. This process was repeated to produce an identical second component. The first component was wrapped around a PVC pipe, with the aluminum facing the inside. The second component was loosely taped around the first piece, with the aluminum facing inwards. As a result, a variable capacitor was made, shown in Figures \ref{fig:mincap} and \ref{fig:maxcap}. The two black cables running act as the two terminals of the capacitor.


\section{Building the High-Pass and Low-Pass Filter Circuits}

\noindent Figures \ref{fig:HPF} and \ref{fig:LPF} show the circuit schematic for the produced HPF and LPF circuits. Furthermore, as a more practical representation, Figure \ref{fig:cad} approximately shows how the LPF circuit was implemented. 



\noindent To build the LPF circuit, a BNC splitter was attached to the AC power supply. One of the outputs was connected directly to the oscilloscope, to visualize the power being supplied to the circuitry. The other output was connected directly to the resistor, which was connected in parallel with the capacitor. The power line of the circuit was finally connected to the oscilloscope, displaying the output voltage of the circuit. The LPF circuit operates on the principal that capacitors are reactive devices, acting as high resistance components to low frequency signals; therefore, low frequency signals pass almost directly to the oscilloscope, but a high frequency signal results in a much lower voltage output (see Figure \ref{fig:falstad1}).




\noindent Similarly, to build the HPF circuit, the BNC splitter was utilized again to visualize input and output voltage. This time the capacitor was connected in series with the resistor. In this case, because capacitors act as high resistance towards low-frequency signals, only the high-frequency signals pass through the capacitor and thus reach the oscilloscope (see Figure \ref{fig:falstad2}.




\section{Results}

\noindent As briefly explained, varying the frequency of the input voltage affects the output signal. The relation between the output and the input signal can be meaningfully described using gain, which is the ratio between the output voltage and the input voltage. Figure \ref{fig:tableLPF} and \ref{fig:tableHPF} represent the gain at varied frequencies at maximum capacitance, when the area shared between the two foil sheets was maximized. For the experiment, a $1V$ input signal was provided to both the HPF and LPF circuits. Therefore, the calculation of gain was simplified to just the output signal, as $\frac{x}{1} = x$ \\

\noindent The tables (see Figure \ref{fig:tableLPF} and \ref{fig:tableHPF}) support the claim that, for the HPF, as frequency increases the gain decreases. On the other hand, for the LPF, as frequency increases the gain increases. Furthermore, graphing the data (see Figure \ref{fig:graph1} and \ref{fig:graph2}) allows for visualizing the cutoff frequency of the two circuits. Cutoff frequency refers to the frequency at which the output signal is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$, approximately 0.707, of the input voltage within the passing band. The cutoff frequency is a tool used to label the boundary between the passband and stopband, therefore determining the operating range of the filtering circuit.\\



\noindent Graphing the data resulted in obtaining a best fit curve for both the circuits (see Equations \ref{eq:fitLPF} and \ref{eq:fitHPF}). The two fits were then solved for a y-value of $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$ to obtain the cut-off frequencies. 


\begin{equation}
y = -0.7 \times e^{-7.0 \times 10^{-4} \times x ^{1.07}}+0.7
\label{eq:fitLPF}
\end{equation}


\section{Conclusions}

\noindent A capacitor was built using aluminum foil as the conducting material and paper as a dielectric. The capacitor was then used to build HPF and LPF circuits, where a $1V$ input signal was applied across both circuits. Varying the frequency of the input signal and measuring the output voltage allowed for the measurement of gain. Graphing this data and applying an exponential fit led to the cut-off frequency of the two filtering circuits. The cutoff frequency ($F_{r}$) for the LPF circuit was approximately $9982 Hz$ at maximum capacitance, resulting in a calculated value of 0.88 nF. On the other hand, the $F_{r}$ for the HPF circuit was approximately $11583 Hz$, resulting in a calculated value of 0.76 nF. When measured using a LCR meter, the maximum capacitance was 0.82 nF, falling within the calculated range. Similarly, the minimum capacitance was calculated to be approximately 0.46 nF and was measured to be 0.33 nF.\\

\noindent This experiment determined that manipulating the formula for cut-off frequency is a valid method to calculate an unknown capacitance; furthermore, this experiment may have been extended to similarly calculate the unknown resistance of a filtering circuit. The experiment also depicted how a given capacitor, when placed in a deliberate way, filtered different frequencies, resulting in cutoff frequencies in a similar region. Therefore, this quality could be exploited to merge a HPF and LPF circuit to produce a band pass filter (BPF), which would allow for a very narrow band of frequencies to pass through. BPF are crucial to wireless communications, where transmitters are allocated a certain frequency range. Thus, producing an output signal within a certain band assures that the communication does not interfere with other transmitters with their alloted frequency bands.
